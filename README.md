# BTC market intelligence
The btc market intelligence app tells you when coins rise and fall based on trading volume. the machine gives an indicator per volume group designated by the neural network. There are times when the trends are clear and times where they are not, the neural network will tell you this via it's accuracy level, higher accuracy levels are where trends are most present.

(automatic training data generation via curl)
(trainer and predicton neural network)

#Instructions for usage:
Install dependencies, run init_profile.py, wait a few rounds then run trendmaster.py, train the neural network then make predictions, init_profile.py can be run in the background for consecutive training and prediction runs.

#Todo, remove curl.exe dependency(redownload from official website if required)
